# üöÄ How to Send 10,000 Emails/Day

## üìä Current vs Target

| Metric | Current (2K/day) | Target (10K/day) | Increase |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Daily Emails | 2,000 | 10,000 | 5x |
| Monthly Volume | 60,000 | 300,000 | 5x |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### 1. Email Warmup (CRITICAL!)

**Don't go from 2K to 10K overnight!**

**Proper Ramp-Up:**

| Week | Daily Emails | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Week 1 | 2,000 | Current level |
| Week 2 | 3,500 | +75% increase |
| Week 3 | 5,000 | +43% increase |
| Week 4 | 7,000 | +40% increase |
| Week 5 | 8,500 | +21% increase |
| Week 6 | 10,000 | +18% increase |

**Why:**
- Prevents spam filters
- Maintains sender reputation
- Avoids blacklisting
- Better deliverability

---

### 2. Deliverability Monitoring

**Track These Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Warning | Action |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Open Rate | 40-60% | <30% | Pause & investigate |
| Bounce Rate | <2% | >5% | Check email quality |
| Spam Rate | <0.1% | >0.5% | Improve copy |
| Reply Rate | 5-15% | <3% | Optimize messaging |

## üí° Pro Tips for 10K/Day

### 1. Use Multiple Campaigns

Don't send 10K from one campaign. Split into 5 campaigns of 2K each:

- Better A/B testing
- Different targeting
- Easier management
- Better analytics

### 2. Rotate Sending Domains

Don't send all emails from one domain:

- Spread across 10-15 domains
- 2-3 accounts per domain
- Better reputation
- Lower spam risk

### 3. Time Your Sends

Don't send all 10K at once:

- Spread throughout business hours
- 8 AM - 6 PM (recipient timezone)
- ~1,250 emails per hour
- Looks more natural

### 4. Monitor & Adjust

Check daily:

- Open rates
- Bounce rates
- Spam complaints
- Reply rates

If any metric drops, pause and investigate.

### 5. Segment Your Lists

Target different groups:

- By location (state/city)
- By industry (tech, healthcare, etc.)
- By company size (11-20, 21-50, etc.)
- By revenue ($1M-5M, $5M-10M, etc.)

Better targeting = better results.
