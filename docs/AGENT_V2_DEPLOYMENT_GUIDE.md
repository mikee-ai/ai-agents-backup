## 🚨 Important Notes

### Inframail API Endpoints

**Note:** The Inframail API endpoints in the code are placeholders.

**Why:** Inframail's exact API structure isn't publicly documented in detail.

**What to do:**

1. **Check Inframail docs:** https://app.inframail.io/api-docs
2. **Or contact support:** support@inframail.io
3. **Get exact endpoints for:**
   - List accounts
   - Create account
   - Get credentials

**Alternative:** Create accounts manually in Inframail dashboard, then the agent will use them.

### Email Warmup

**New accounts need warmup!**

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: 50 emails/day
- Week 2: 100 emails/day
- Week 3: 200 emails/day
- Week 4+: 400 emails/day

**Inframail handles this automatically!**

**To send 2,000 tomorrow:**
- Use pre-warmed accounts, OR
- Start with 500/day and scale up

```
