### Phase 2: Email Infrastructure Optimization

#### Current Inframail Setup

Based on their pricing:

**Unlimited Plan ($99/month):**
- 1 dedicated IP
- 50+ meetings/month capacity
- 5 domain setups per day
- Unlimited email inboxes

**Agency Pack ($249/month):**

#### Recommendations

**For 2,000 emails/day:**
- **Minimum:** 4-5 email accounts (at 400-500 emails/day each)
- **Recommended:** 10 email accounts (at 200 emails/day each) ‚úÖ You have this!
- **Optimal:** 20 email accounts (at 100 emails/day each) - Better deliverability

**Why more accounts = better:**
- Lower volume per account = less spam risk
- Better sender reputation
- Higher deliverability rates
- More IP diversity

---

### Phase 3: Domain Strategy

#### How Many Domains Do You Need?

**Rule of thumb:** 1 domain per 3-5 email accounts

For 10 email accounts:
- **Minimum:** 2-3 domains
- **Recommended:** 3-4 domains

**Example Setup:**
- `mikeeai.com` ‚Üí mikee@, contact@, hello@
- `mikeeaipro.com` ‚Üí mikee@, sales@, info@
- `getmikeeai.com` ‚Üí mikee@, team@, support@
- `trymikeeai.com` ‚Üí mikee@, hello@, reach@

#### Domain Warmup

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-7: SPF, DKIM, DMARC setup
- Days 8-14: Send 10-20 emails/day
- Days 15-21: Send 30-50 emails/day
- Days 22-30: Send 75-100 emails/day
- Days 31+: Full volume

**Inframail handles this automatically!**

### Phase 4: Campaign Optimization

#### Current Campaign Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your campaign sends 30 emails in 30 minutes per lead!**

This is problematic because:
- Extremely aggressive
- Will trigger spam filters
- Overwhelms recipients
- Damages sender reputation

#### Recommended Changes

**Option 1: Spread Out Over Days**
- Step 1: Day 0
- Step 2: Day 2
- Step 3: Day 4
- Step 4: Day 7
- Step 5: Day 10

**Option 2: Reduce to 3-5 Steps**
- Step 1: Initial outreach
- Step 2: Follow-up (2 days later)
- Step 3: Value add (4 days later)
- Step 4: Final touch (7 days later)

**Option 3: Keep Current (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
- Only if you're testing or have very specific use case
- High risk of spam complaints
