## üíµ Monthly Cost Breakdown

### 1. Apollo.io - Lead Generation

**Cost:** **$99/month**

- ‚úÖ Unlimited email credits
- ‚úÖ API access
- ‚úÖ Advanced filters
- ‚úÖ 2,000 leads/day = 60,000/month

### 2. Instantly.ai - Email Sending Platform

**Current Setup:** 10 email accounts sending

**Pricing Tiers:**

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Email Accounts | Daily Sends | Your Fit |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Growth | $30/mo | 1 account | 200/day | ‚ùå Too small |
| Hypergrowth | $77.60/mo | 3 accounts | 1,500/day | ‚ö†Ô∏è Close but not enough |
| Light Speed | $286.30/mo | 10 accounts | 5,000/day | ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED** |

**Recommended:** **Light Speed - $286.30/month**
