## 🎯 What You Need to Send 2K Tomorrow

### Required Infrastructure

To send 2,000 emails/day safely, you need:

**Minimum:** 4 email accounts (500 emails/day each)  
**Recommended:** 5-10 email accounts (200-400 emails/day each)

---

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

### ✅ 1. Verify Instantly.ai Plan

**Check your current plan:**

Go to: https://app.instantly.ai/settings/billing

**What you need:**

| Your Goal | Minimum Plan | Cost | Email Accounts |
|-----------|--------------|------|----------------|
| 2,000/day | Hypergrowth | $77.60/mo | 3 accounts (667/day each) |
| 2,000/day (safer) | Light Speed | $286.30/mo | 10 accounts (200/day each) |

**⚠️ Important:**
- If you have **Growth plan** ($30/mo, 1 account): ❌ Won't work - upgrade needed
- If you have **Hypergrowth** ($77.60/mo, 3 accounts): ⚠️ Will work but aggressive
- If you have **Light Speed** ($286.30/mo, 10 accounts): ✅ Perfect!

---

### ✅ 2. Set Up Email Accounts

**Option A: Use Inframail.io (RECOMMENDED)**

You already have Inframail.io Unlimited ($99/mo).

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://inframail.io/dashboard
2. Create 5-10 email accounts
3. Inframail will:
   - Set up domains automatically

   - Start email warmup
   - Handle deliverability

**Time:** 15-30 minutes

---

**Option B: Use Your Own Domains**

If you have your own domains:

1. Buy 3-5 domains (if you don't have them)
2. Set up email accounts (Gmail Workspace, Outlook, etc.)
3. Configure DNS records
4. Manually warm up accounts

**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**⚠️ Not recommended** - Use Inframail instead

---

### ✅ 3. Connect Email Accounts to Instantly

   - Enter email address
   - Enter password
   - Set daily limit: 200-500 emails/day
   - Enable account

**Recommended Settings:**

| Accounts | Emails/Day Each | Total/Day | Safety Level |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| 10 accounts | 200/day | 2,000/day | ✅ Safest |
| 5 accounts | 400/day | 2,000/day | ✅ Safe |
