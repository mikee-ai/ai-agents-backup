## 🚀 How to Start

### Step 1: Deploy to VPS (Already Done ✅)

The agent is already on your VPS at:
`/root/lead_agent/autonomous_lead_agent_safe_ramp.py`

### Step 2: Test Run (10 min)

```bash
# SSH to VPS
ssh root@31.97.145.136

# Test with 10 leads
cd /root/lead_agent
python3 -c "
import autonomous_lead_agent_safe_ramp as agent
agent.ACCOUNTS_TO_CREATE_PER_DAY = 2  # Just 2 for testing
schedule = agent.AutonomousLeadAgent()
schedule.stats['leads_to_import_today'] = 10
schedule.run_daily_import()
"
```

This creates 2 test accounts and imports 10 leads.

### Step 3: Run Day 1 (30 min)

```bash
cd /root/lead_agent
python3 autonomous_lead_agent_safe_ramp.py
```

**What happens:**
- Creates 1-2 domains
- Creates 20 email accounts
- Connects to Instantly
- Imports 600 leads
- Done!

### Step 4: Enable Daily Automation

```bash
# Update cron job
crontab -e

# Add or update:
0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /root/lead_agent/autonomous_lead_agent_safe_ramp.py >> /root/lead_agent/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

**Then it runs automatically every day!**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Inframail API Endpoints

**Note:** The Inframail API endpoints in the code are placeholders.

**Why:** Inframail's API documentation isn't publicly detailed.

**What to do:**

**Option 1 - Use Inframail API (Recommended)**
1. Contact Inframail support: support@inframail.io
2. Ask for API documentation for:
   - Creating domains
   - Creating email accounts
   - Getting account credentials
3. Update the code with real endpoints

**Option 2 - Manual Setup (Easier for now)**
1. Create domains manually in Inframail dashboard
2. Create email accounts manually
3. Agent will detect and use them
4. Still get automated lead import

---

### Instantly Account Limits

**Check your Instantly plan:**

```bash
# How many accounts can you have?
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YjUzNzFjY2EtZGNiNC00OTIzLTgxZGYtZDg1Nzc3YzY5OTg3OlRvZHBXZm9Fb2xqUA==" \
  https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/account/limits
```

**If limited to 10 accounts:**
- Upgrade to Hyper Growth plan
- Allows 100+ accounts
- Required for 2,000 emails/day

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Manual + Automated Hybrid

If Inframail API isn't available, use this approach:

### Manual Part (You do once per day, 10 min)

**Day 1:**
1. Go to Inframail dashboard
2. Create 1 domain: `aiagents11.com`
3. Create 20 email accounts: `outreach11@...` through `outreach30@...`
4. Note credentials

**Day 2:**
1. Create domain: `aiagents21.com`
2. Create 20 more accounts
3. Note credentials

*Repeat for Days 3-5*

### Automated Part (Agent does automatically)

**Every day at 6 AM:**
1. Agent detects new accounts in Instantly
2. Calculates daily capacity
3. Imports appropriate number of leads
4. Adds to campaign

**You still get:**
- ✅ Automated lead import
- ✅ Smart capacity management
- ✅ Daily execution
- ⚠️ Manual account creation (10 min/day)
